        <ul>
          <li><b>June 28, 1971</b> - son of a Canadian mother and a South African
            father, Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, South
            Africa. He spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister
            Tosca in South Africa, and <b>at 10</b>, the introverted Elon
            developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program,
            and <b>when he was 12</b> he made his first software sale—of a game
            he created called Blastar. </li>
          <li><b>1989</b> - at age 17, he moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University
            and avoid mandatory service in the South African military</li>
          <li><b>1992</b> - left to study business and physics at the University of
            Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and
            stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.</li>
          <li><b>1997</b> - after leaving Penn, Elon Musk headed to Stanford University
            in California to pursue a Ph.D in energy physics. However, his move was
            timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after
            just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2
            Corporation. </li>
          <li><b>1999</b> - an online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the
            new Web sites of both the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune, a division of
            Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million
            in stock options.</li>
          <li><b>Also in 1999</b> - Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial
            services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the
            creation of PayPal as it is known today.</li>
          <li><b>October 2002</b> - PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock.
            Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.</li>
          <li><b>2002</b> - never one to rest on his laurels, Musk founded his
            third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX,
            with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel.
            <b>By 2008</b>, SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company
             the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space
             Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move
             to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions. The boundless potential
             of space exploration and the preservation of the future of the human
             race have become the cornerstones of Musk's abiding interests, and
             toward these he has founded the Musk Foundation, which is dedicated
             to space exploration and the discovery of renewable and clean energy
             sources. </li>
          <li><b>2003</b> - Musk venture is Tesla Motors, a company dedicated to
            producing affordable, mass-market electric cars. Five years after its
            formation, the company <b>in 2008</b> unveiled the Roadster, a sports
            car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, as well
            traveling nearly 250 miles between charges of its lithum ion battery.
            With a stake in the company taken by Daimler and a strategic
            partnership with Toyota, Tesla Motors launched its initial public
            offering <b>in June 2010</b>, raising $226 million.</li>
          <li><b>On May 22, 2012</b> -  Musk and SpaceX made history when the
            company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned
            capsule.</li>
            <li><b>August 2013</b> - Musk has continued his work in attempting
              to make his innovative ideas a reality. He released a concept for
              a new form of transportation called the "Hyperloop", an invention
              that would foster commuting between major cities while severely
              cutting travel time. Ideally resistant to weather and powered by
              renewable energy, the Hyperloop would propel riders in pods through
               a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 mph.
               Musk noted that the Hyperloop could take from seven to 10 years
               to be built and ready for use.</li>
          <li><b>August 2016</b> - Musk continuing effort to promote and advance
            sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, a $2.6 billion
            dollar deal was solidified to combine his electric car and solar
            energy companies. His Tesla Motors Inc. announced an all-stock deal
            purchase of SolarCity Corp., a company Musk had helped his cousins
            start in 2006. He is a majority shareholder in each entity.
            “<em>Solar and storage are at their best when they're combined.
              As one company, Tesla (storage) and SolarCity (solar) can create
              fully integrated residential, commercial and grid-scale products
              that improve the way that energy is generated, stored and consumed
              ”</em>, read a statement on Tesla’s website about the deal.</li>
